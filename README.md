The "GameUniverse" project of ours centers on creating a dynamic 78-column database system for Steam Game Data sourced from Steam's API. Our core objectives include implementing a user-friendly front-end interface for CRUD operations with real-time updates, along with a robust keyword search and advanced conditional filtering. To enhance sophistication, we'll integrate stored procedures and triggers to optimize data management and security.

This project not only aims to fulfill its foundational functionalities but also harbors creative potential for additional features, as proposed. By offering a user-friendly interface, we aspire to be a valuable resource for gamers, researchers, and enthusiasts eager to explore Steam's extensive game library. Our goal is to provide an immersive and interactive experience, unlocking hidden gems and insights within the vast world of Steam games.
